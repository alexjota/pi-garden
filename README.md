# pi-garden
My Internet of Plants project. RaspberryPi + Node + Azure

The objective of this project is to learn and tackle common IoT challenges like security, device provisioning, device management, data ingestion, data processing and having fun.

The device (Raspberry Pi + sensors, using Node) pushes telemetry data to the cloud (temperature, humidity...) and receives commands all through Azure IoT Hubs. Also playing with Facebook integration and testing device login flow.
